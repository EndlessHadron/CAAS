# Email Service Comparison: SendGrid vs Gmail API

## Quick Recommendation
**For your use case: Gmail API is the better choice** - It's completely free for your volume and integrates well with Google Cloud.

## SendGrid

### Free Tier
- **100 emails/day forever free**
- No credit card required
- Full API access

### Pros
- ✅ Industry standard for transactional emails
- ✅ Great deliverability
- ✅ Rich analytics dashboard
- ✅ Email templates
- ✅ Easy integration

### Cons
- ❌ **Only 100 emails/day on free tier** (too limiting)
- ❌ Requires upgrading to paid plan for growth
- ❌ Another service to manage

### Setup Complexity
- Easy - Just API key needed
- 15 minutes to implement

## Gmail API (Recommended)

### Free Tier
- **1,000,000,000 quota units/day** (basically unlimited for your needs)
- Approx 250-500 emails/day easily
- Uses your existing Gmail account

### Pros
- ✅ **Completely FREE for your volume**
- ✅ Already in Google ecosystem (you're using GCP)
- ✅ No additional accounts needed
- ✅ Great deliverability from Gmail
- ✅ Can use neatly@gmail.com or custom domain

### Cons
- ❌ Slightly more complex setup (OAuth2)
- ❌ Daily sending limits per account (but sufficient)
- ❌ Less analytics than SendGrid

### Setup Complexity
- Medium - OAuth2 setup required
- 30-45 minutes to implement

## Gmail API Limits (Free)
- **Messages per day**: 250-500 (grows with account age)
- **Recipients per message**: 100
- **Recipients per day**: 500-1000
- **API calls**: 1 billion quota units/day

## Cost Comparison

### Your Expected Volume
- New users: ~20/day = 20 verification emails
- Bookings: ~30/day = 60 emails (confirmation + reminders)
- Payments: ~25/day = 25 emails
- **Total: ~105 emails/day**

### Costs
- **Gmail API**: $0 forever
- **SendGrid**: Free but limited to 100/day (won't work)
- **SendGrid Essentials**: $19.95/month for 50k emails

## Implementation Plan with Gmail API

### 1. Create Service Account Email
```
noreply@theneatlyapp.com (or use existing Gmail)
```

### 2. Enable Gmail API
- Already in your Google Cloud Project
- No additional cost

### 3. Authentication Methods

#### Option A: Service Account (Recommended for production)
- Uses Google Workspace (requires custom domain)
- Fully automated, no manual auth needed

#### Option B: OAuth2 with Refresh Token (Good for MVP)
- Uses regular Gmail account
- One-time manual authorization
- Refresh token lasts forever

### 4. Email Templates We'll Create
1. **Account Verification** - Verify your email
2. **Welcome Email** - Welcome to neatly!
3. **Booking Confirmation** - Your cleaning is confirmed
4. **Payment Success** - Payment received
5. **Booking Reminder** - Cleaning tomorrow at 2pm
6. **Cleaner Assignment** - John will be your cleaner
7. **Booking Cancellation** - Booking cancelled
8. **Rating Request** - How was your service?
9. **Password Reset** - Reset your password

## Recommended Approach

1. **Start with Gmail API + OAuth2**
   - Use a dedicated Gmail account: `neatly.notifications@gmail.com`
   - Implement OAuth2 with refresh token
   - Store refresh token in Secret Manager
   - This is FREE and sufficient for MVP

2. **Future Growth Path**
   - When you exceed 500 emails/day
   - Either: Get Google Workspace ($6/month) for higher limits
   - Or: Move to SendGrid ($19.95/month)

| Cost | ✅ Free | ❌ Limited free tier |
