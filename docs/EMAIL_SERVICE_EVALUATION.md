## Implementation Plan

### Gmail API Setup (Immediate)
```python
# Initial implementation
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

class EmailService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.service = self._build_service()
    
    def send_email(self, to: str, subject: str, body: str):
        # Implementation
        pass
```

### Migration Path
1. Abstract email service interface
2. Implement Gmail API provider
3. Add SendGrid provider later
4. Switch via environment variable
